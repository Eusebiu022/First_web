    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple recipe for fried rice</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <l1>2 cups cooked white rice</l1>
        <l2>2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable or canola oil</l2>
        <l3>1 small onion, finely chopped</l3>
        <l4>1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into small dice</l4>
        <l5>2 scallions, thinly sliced</l5>
        <l6>2 medium cloves garlic, minced</l6>
        <l7>1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce</l7>
        <l8>1 teaspoon (5ml) toasted sesame oil</l8>
        <l9>Kosher salt and ground white pepper</l9>
        <l10>1 large egg</l10>
        <l11>4 ounces (115g) frozen peas</l11>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <l1>
            If using day-old rice (see note), 
            transfer to a medium bowl and break the rice up with your hands into individual grains before proceeding. 
            Heat 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) vegetable oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. 
            Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until the rice is pale brown and toasted and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. 
            Transfer to a medium bowl. 
            Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice.
        </l1>
        <l2>
            Return all the rice to the wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. 
            Add 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil to the space. 
            Add onion, carrot, scallions, and garlic and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. 
            Toss with rice to combine. Add soy sauce and sesame oil and toss to coat. 
            Season to taste with salt and white pepper.
        </l2>
        <l3>
            Push rice to the side of the wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil. 
            Break the egg into the oil and season with a little salt. 
            Use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits. 
            Toss the egg and the rice together.
        </l3>
        <l4>
            Add frozen peas and continue to toss and stir until peas are thawed 
            and every grain of rice is separate. Serve immediately.
        </l4>
    </ol>
